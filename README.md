Desk Calculator application as taught in the book The C++ Programming Language from B. Stroustrup and Addison Wesley

## Description

This respository is a collection of Desk Calculator apps that I made by following the Stroustrup instructions by reading his book.

The purpose here is just to collect references of simple examples of valid C++ applications that I can use as a reference in the future.

## Variations of the complete application

[Procedural code organized in namespaces](https://github.com/fabio-blanco/desk_calculator/tree/main/chapter_9) The Desk Calculator (dc) modularized with namespaces.
[Object Oriented version](https://github.com/fabio-blanco/desk_calculator/tree/main/oop_calc) The Desk Calculator (dc) orgnized in classes.

## Lisense

This application and it's source code is licensed under [MIT license](https://github.com/fabio-blanco/desk_calculator/blob/main/LICENSE).

Basically you can use it, fork it at your own will but, please, do reference my work and do referente the book from Stroustrup becouse the code originated there.
