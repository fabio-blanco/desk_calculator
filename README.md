Desk Calculator application as taught in the book The C++ Programming Language from B. Stroustrup and Addison Wesley

## Description

This respository is a collection of Desk Calculator apps that I made by following the Stroustrup instructions by reading his book.

The purpose here is just to collect references of simple examples of valid C++ applications that I can use as a reference in the future.
