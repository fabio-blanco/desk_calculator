# Desk Calculator Object Oriented

## Description

A simple calculator parser application written in c++ and logically organized in classes.

### Origin

This code was based on the exercise 16 from the chapter 10 of the book _The C++ Programming Language_ from _B. Stroustrup and Addison Wesley_.

### The statement of the exercise mentioned

> 16. (∗2) Define a **Calculator** class for which the calculator functions from §6.1 provide most of the
> implementation. Create **Calculators** and invoke them for input from `cin`, from command-line
> arguments, and for strings in the program. Allow output to be delivered to a variety of targets
> similar to the way input can be obtained from a variety of sources.

### Note:

Although the exercise states: 
> to allow output to be delivered to a variety of targets

I've not done so. My main goal was just to make the code, object oriented. Maybe it can be done in a next implementation.
